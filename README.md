* 💫 I am mainly a "graphic designer" but sometimes a translator or a programmer.

* 🎰 I am too a fan of gambling CS:GO skins, and losing all the money in it.

* 🎶 My musical taste mainly depends on my mood, but in short... Indie, Indie Rock, Breakcore, Pop, Hip Hop and Rap. Although I am open to any kind of music.
